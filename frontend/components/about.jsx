      <h1>Welcome to Wine with Strangers!</h1>
      <h3>Our organization was founded on September 29th, 2017 to share the joys of wine and meeting new people. Many thanks to Tea with Strangers on which I based my idea. This project was also inspired by my recent, but intense pursuit of web development. With the help of the wonderful instructors and fellow students at App Academy, I built this web application from front to back using React.js, Redux, Ruby on Rails, Postgresql topped with a little bit of CSS. It was my first full stack project and I look forward to doing many. If you would like to hire me, please contact me through your prefered channel. The footer below this page links to several of my social media accounts. More importantly though, if you would like to buy me a glass of wine at your favorite bar, I would very much like to meet up and enjoy your company. Red wine only please.</h3>
